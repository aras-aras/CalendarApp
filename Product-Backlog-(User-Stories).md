[TODO] Product Backlog deliverable

Complete Product Backlog, with all PBIs (Product Backlog Items - User Stories).

User Stories should be given a proper id and should abide by the "As a <user role>, I want <goal>, so that <reason>" format and contain specific details (e.g, conditions of satisfaction, constraints, ...) if applicable. The user stories should be prioritised using the MoSCoW method.
