However, there are some restrictions in the fields. In the username field, you must create an account with a username that does not already exist. In the birthday field, you should enter your birthday in the format dd-mm-yyyy. Related to the password, you need to have more than 6 characters in order to successfully create your account.
An event with your birthday will be created wishing you a happy birthday!

To easily navigate on the application you have a sidebar, that allows you to either go to your daily view, to your account settings or to just simply log out.
