# CalendarApp

This repository houses all of the SCRUM processes that were implemented during the design and development of a calendar app. The app was created as part of the Software Project course, which is a requirement for the first year of the Electrical and Computer Engineering master's degree program. By following these SCRUM processes, the team was able to effectively manage the project and deliver a high-quality product.

This project provided me with valuable experience working as part of a team and managing the development process. In addition, I had the opportunity to learn new programming languages, including Java and SQL. As a result, I gained a deeper understanding of database architecture and learned how to effectively navigate and manipulate databases.
